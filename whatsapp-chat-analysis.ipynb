Now we just have to survive the next few months of waiting!\\n\\n17/10/23, 9:45\\u202fam - Neha Gupta: Morning! Had a thought - should we learn some basic French and Italian phrases before the trip? Could be helpful!\\n\\n17/10/23, 9:47\\u202fam - Rhea Sharma: That's a great idea! We should practice common travel phrases so we can navigate easily. Where should we start?\\n\\n17/10/23, 9:49\\u202fam - Neha Gupta: I found some helpful YouTube videos for Italian and French phrases/conversation. Let's watch them together this weekend?\\n\\n17/10/23, 9:51\\u202fam - Rhea Sharma: Perfect plan! We'll be chatting away with the locals in no time.

This trip planning has been so fun, 3 months feels so close. This is going to be the best girls trip!\\n\\n20/10/23, 6:45\\u202fpm - Rhea Sharma: Hey!

      "Neha and Rhea are planning a girls trip to Goa for the long weekend. Neha booked their flights and hotel and they are all set for Goa this weekend. The hotel is the Grand Hyatt in North Goa and the flight is at 9am on Saturday. I'm so excited, we're going to have the best time!Should we book any activities?Hm we could book a boat cruise one day to see the islands.And maybe parasailing!We'll plan the activities when we get there.Let's meet Friday evening to pack?Sounds good!I'll come to your place after work around 6.Woohoo Goa 2023 here we come!!See you Friday :) Omg that street food was incredible!I ate way too much haha Me too, that was such a fun experience!The live music was so good as well.What's the plan for tomorrow?Let's take it easy in the morning after all that food.Maybe a boat cruise at noon?Boat cruise sounds perfect!Maybe we can pack a picnic lunch from the hotel.I'm in!Let's do it!We have to try the Goan fish curry and vind Last night was wild!My feet are killing me from all the dancing haha Omg I'm exhausted too but it was so worth it!We raged until 4am lol. Maybe a chill beach evening today?Cocktails and sunset?That sounds so nice!A relaxing last day. Can't wait. This trip went by too fast but it was exactly what we needed! Back to real life tomorrow but at least we're tan and rested now haha. Let's plan another trip soon, maybe the mountains next!Oooh yes, that would be amazing!Can't wait for our next adventure :) See you at 5! Video call between Rhea and Neha is the perfect antidote to post-vacation blues. Barcelona, Madrid, Paris, Venice, Rome! It's going to be the trip of a lifetime! Let's start looking for Airbnbs in each city.Should we do 3 nights in each or mix it up? Found some great Airbnb options for each city!Sending you links to look through.Checking now!These apartments are so cute.Love the ones with balconies and rooftop access.I'm leaning towards 3 everywhere.Yeah 3 nights sounds good, enough time to see the sights without rushing too much. Make a shared Pinterest board to pin places we want to see, food to eat, outfits to pack!Oooh smart idea!We can use it to plan out each city.7 months to go!Better start prepping those outfits. Time to hit the shops this weekend for cute Eurotrip clothes inspo. We should practice common travel phrases so we can navigate easily. I found some helpful YouTube videos for Italian and French phrases/conversation. I'll make a notes list on my phone of stuff to pack. I was thinking packing cubes? And phone chargers with adapters!Ooh yes, packing cubes are a must! And definitely adapters.comfort shoes too for all the walking we'll do. 2 months and counting, woohoo! Rise and shine! I was too excited this morning and made uslittle Europe 2024 countdown calendars. Only 50 days to go!!You're the best, only 50 days till our trip. You're theBest. I love you. Can you believe we leave in just 1 month?!I'm trying to learn some key Italian phrases but it's hard!I know, so soon!The Italian is tricky but we'll get there.Look what I got us!Matching neck pillows for the long flights!Now we can nap in style! Let's meet Sunday to do a final pack and go over all details?So excited!! Yes!Final checks on Sunday, can't wait!Europe 2024 here we come!! One more day!!See you tonight, ready for the best girls trip ever? Spain, here wecome!\n"
